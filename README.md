## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The first answer and second answer is easy to think. 

Just doing search(bfs or dfs) and count the not -visited location and if some location is not visited , raise the number of room and do dfs again.

Repeat this (0,0) to (N-1, M-1) will work.

For the third answer, I though make visit array 3d and do search with information that I break wall or not, but because we just want to know the max size,
just searching from (0,0) to (N-1 , M-1) and search NWES will work if we save the room size and and fill visit with diffrent number.


## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
